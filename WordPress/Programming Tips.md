# Programming tips

## The Basics
- Write pseudocode
	- think of the problem and find the solution to it
- Break problem down to small parts
- Define a function before calling it
- Use OOP to break the software to various parts, not just the process
- Thinking of variables, arrays, hashes, functions, etc as objects helps you improve on your coding
- classes define attributes (properties) and behavior (methods)

## On documenting
- Properly document your code, so that you'll understand it a year later. Especially document functions
- Follow the style guideline

## On improving my coding
- Avoid a God function / class
	- Break it down to the S of SOLID principle [https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php/episodes/1]
	- Extract functions into its own classes if needed

- Simpler rules for simpler code [https://laracasts.com/series/simple-rules-for-simpler-code]
	- No abbrevations
	- don't use "Else"
	- one level of indentation
	- limit your instance variables (to 5 max)
	- wrap primitives (sometimes)

## Donâ€™t repeat yourself
- DRY - move repeated code to separate function/file
	- write code once, use often
	- consider using a function within a function (python)
	- Use conditional tags
