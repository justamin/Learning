#Programming tips

- Write pseudocode
	- think of the problem and find the solution to it
- Break problem down to small parts
- Use WordPress Core functions if possible
- Define a function before calling it
- Properly document your code, so that you'll understand it a year later. Especially document functions
- Follow the style guideline
- Use OOP to break the software to various parts, not just the process
- classes define attributes (properties) and behavior (methods)

#Donâ€™t repeat yourself
- DRY - move repeated code to separate function/file
	- write code once, use often
	- consider using a function within a function (python)
	- Use conditional tags

#For Themes
- Use get_template_part
- Extend get_template_part with function variables
